# cs194-project

Some notes from Chase:

On Unity:
	Hopefully you have Unity installed and are starting to get comfortable with its UI.
	In order to open the project, simply click on the scene file in Unity_Files\Assets currently titled Sample Scene (real Creative, I know)

On Models:
	I'm currently making (really simple) models in 3ds max. These should hopefully serve as placeholders until we have more complex models

	Because the hex tiles are imported from 3ds max, I'm having some difficulty preserving the scale and size. Until I figure out how to get the scaling right in Unity, determining the location of the hex tiles has been guess and check. If anyone can figure out the maths so that it is easy to transform the tiles, that would be great.
